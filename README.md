# application

## purpose

One of my hobby is map collection. Map could be an art, a record of human civilization more than a tool.
I hope to build a simple web app as a platform to share my favorite map images from either my collection or online resource.
This platform will also support comments from me or others on these map images.

## requirements

Store and display map images.
Create, view and reply comment in a page of image.

## implementation

Actually, using express in code generation is quite comfortable, but I did not.
This project is a mean stack implementation. 
This project follows MVC and REST design requirements.

Following targets are listed as follows:

### Target 1
Provide basic image service.

### Target 2
Add comment and reply service.

### Target 3
Add user registry and login service.
