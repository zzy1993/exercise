# application

## purpose

One of my hobby is map collection. Map could be an art, a record of human civilization more than a tool.
I hope to build a simple web app as a platform to share my favorite map images from either my collection or online resource.
This platform will also support comments from me or others on these map images.

## requirements

Store and display map images.
Create, view and reply comment in a page of image.

## implementation

This project is a mean stack implementation. 
This project follows MVC and REST design requirements.
