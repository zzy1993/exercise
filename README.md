# application

## purpose

I am now building a simple web app to share my favourite images.
This platform will also support comments from me or others on these map images.

## requirements

Store and display map images.
Create, view and reply comment in a page of image.

## implementation

Actually, using express in code generation is quite comfortable, but I did not.
This project is a mean stack implementation. 
This project follows MVC and REST design requirements.

Targets are listed as follows:

* Provide basic image service. (11/21 achieved)

* Add comment and reply service. (11/26 achieved)

* Add user registry and login service, bind account with Google.
